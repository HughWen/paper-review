# Towards the Science of Security and Privacy in Machine Learning

## Abstract

In recent years, the machine learning is used in *a dizzying array of* applications. The authors write this survey to *articulate* a comprehensive threat model for ML and categorize attacks and defenses within an adversarial framework.

## Introduction

In introduction part, the authors firstly state the popularity of ML and lead to the issues of privacy and security. Then, the authors claim that their motivation and challenge is the fragmentation of these several area: machine learning, security, and so on. So the authors decide to systematize knowledge about the myriad of security and privacy issues that involve ML. This paper develop a unified perspective on security and privacy in ML.

The contributions of this paper are:
- Inroducing a unifying threat model to allow structured resonning about the security and privacy of systems that incorporate machine learning (part 3).
- Taxonomizing attacks and defenses identified by the various technical communities s informed elements of PAC learning theory (section 4, 5, 6).
- Introducing a "no free lunch theorem" for adversarial machine learning (section 7).
