# Deep Multi-Task Learning for Aspect Term Extraction with Memory Interaction∗

## Motivation

- Solve the problem of aspect term extraction (ATE) from user review sentences, which is a supporting task for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis （ABSA)

## Idea

- Aspect Terms and Opinion Words always co-occur
- Multi-tasking
- Memory interaction network (MIN)
    - Two LSTMs with extended memory are designed for handling the extraction tasks of aspects and opinions.
    - A third LSTM for sentimental sentence classification facilitating more accurate aspect term extraction.
