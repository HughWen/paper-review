# Multi-task Memory Networks for Category-speciÔ¨Åc Aspect and Opinion Terms Co-extraction

## Motivation

- Generate more detailed and structured opinion analysis.
- Provide a more useful end-to-end analysis, which can extracte and classify aspect/opinion terms simultaneously.

## Idea

- aspect/opinion terms extraction for a specific category is considered as a task, and all the tahsks are learned jointly by exploring commonalities and relationships among them.
- consider terms extraction for each specific category as an individual task, and design a memory network to co-extract aspect terms and opinion terms within each task via dual label propagation.

## Model

## Evaluation

## Contribution

- Provide a model that can achieve both extraction and categorization for terms simultaneously.
